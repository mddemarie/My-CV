## How to use this CV as Template

1. Install the LaTeX
2. Clone this repo
3. Open TeXShop (= LaTex that you just installed)
4. In LaTeX, click on: File - Open (and choose the repo that you just cloned) - choose a file with .tex file extension. Frontend code of the CV will open.
5. Choose XeLaTex instead of LaTeX. Click on Typeset. There are some errors while compiling. Click several enter until a PDF is generated. The CV will be compiled and the PDF will be generated with all changes that you made.
6. The Backend code of your CV is in deedy-resume.cls. If you make changes there, save it and compile the .tex file for changes to be applied (the file serves the formatting purposes). The compilation of .cls will not work if you click on Typeset.
